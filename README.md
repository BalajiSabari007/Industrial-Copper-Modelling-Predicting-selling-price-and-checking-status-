# Industrial-Copper-Modelling-Predicting-selling-price-and-checking-status:

#Aim-Of-This-Project:
Goal of this project is to build the  two machine learning models for predict the selling price and Checking status(Won/Loss). Manual prediction is time consuming and may not result in optimal price decision. The modles will utilize the advanced techniques such as data normalization, feature scaling, and outlier detection, and leveraging algorithms that are robust to skewed and noisy data. 
 
#Regression Model for Predicting Selling Price:
The copper industry deals with less complex data related to sales and pricing. However, this data may suffer from issues such as skewness and noisy data, which can affect the accuracy of manual predictions. Dealing with these challenges manually can be time-consuming and may not result in optimal pricing decisions. A machine learning regression model can address these issues by utilizing advanced techniques such as data normalization, feature scaling, and outlier detection, and leveraging algorithms that are robust to skewed and noisy data. 

#Classification Model For Checkng Status(Won/Loss):
Another area where the copper industry faces challenges is in capturing the leads. A lead classification model is a system for evaluating and classifying leads based on how likely they are to become a customer . You can use the STATUS variable with WON being considered as Success and LOST being considered as Failure and remove data points other than WON, LOST STATUS values.
