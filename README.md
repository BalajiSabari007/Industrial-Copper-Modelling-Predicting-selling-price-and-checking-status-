#Aim-Of-This-Project
      
Goal of this project is to build the  two machine learning models for predict the selling price and Checking status(Won/Loss). Manual prediction is time consuming and may not result in optimal price decision. The modles will utilize the advanced techniques such as data normalization, feature scaling, and outlier detection, and leveraging algorithms that are robust to skewed and noisy data.
